# Face-emotion-recognition
Convolutional Neural Network was applied on 36K observations to classify 7 facial expressions using ReLu and Softmax activations

fer2013 data is used here to make the model. The data is collected from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedmoorsy/facial-expression/download

This data was firstly used in a Kaggle Challenege :https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data/ , where the winner got 71.2% test accuracy

Here in this model we got 66% test accuracy and 86% train accuracy with adam optimizer

Using GPU in google colab the whole project is done.
